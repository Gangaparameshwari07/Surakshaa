# Surakshaa: Empowering Safer Journeys

Hello and welcome to the Surakshaa project! I developed this application with a singular focus: to enhance safety and peace of mind for anyone venturing into the outdoors, while providing a reliable monitoring solution for their guardians.

## Project Overview

Surakshaa is a real-time location tracking and distress alerting web application designed for trekkers and their support networks. By leveraging robust Google Maps Platform APIs and Firebase services, it creates a dynamic environment where location awareness meets critical safety features.My aim is to provide a comprehensive, intuitive tool that ensures adventurers are never truly alone, and help is always just a click away.

## Core Features

Surakshaa is packed with functionalities built to provide a seamless and secure experience:

### 1. Secure Authentication & User Management
* **Firebase Authentication:** Users can easily sign up and sign in, managing their trekker profile securely.
* **Status Tracking:** User status (signed in, checked-in, checked-out, distress) is dynamically managed and reflected across the platform.

### 2. Real-time Location Tracking
* **Live Map Visualization:** Trekkers' precise locations are displayed in real-time on an interactive Google Map, represented by a clear blue dot.
* **Guardian Monitoring:** Guardians can observe the live movements and status of multiple trekkers from a centralized view.

### 3. Points of Interest (POIs) Layer
* **Strategic Markers:** Important landmarks, emergency shelters, or crucial checkpoints are pre-marked on the map.
* **Enhanced Navigation:** POIs provide critical context for trekkers and assist guardians in understanding the terrain.

### 4. SOS/Distress Alert System
* **One-Click Activation:** A prominent "SOS Help!" button allows trekkers to instantly signal for assistance in emergencies.
* **Immediate Notification:** Activating SOS updates the trekker's status to "distress" on the map (with a red marker) and notifies registered guardians.
* **Timestamping:** Each distress event is recorded with a server timestamp for accurate incident logging.

### 5. Dynamic Trekkers List
* **Real-time Updates:** A dedicated panel displays a live list of all checked-in trekkers and their current safety status (e.g., Checked-in, Distress).
* **Quick Overview:** Provides guardians with an at-a-glance view of who is active and their situation.

### 6. Flexible Session Management
* **Check-in Functionality:** Trekkers can initiate location tracking and mark themselves as "checked-in" when their adventure begins.
* **Check-out Functionality:** Trekkers can end their tracking session, signifying their safe return.

## Technologies Underpinning Surakshaa

* **Frontend:** Built using standard web technologies â€“ **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for interactive functionalities.
* **Mapping:** Powered by the comprehensive **Google Maps JavaScript API** for robust map rendering and location services.
* **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** We leverage **Google Firebase** extensively for its scalable and real-time capabilities:
    * **Firebase Authentication:** Handles secure user sign-up and sign-in processes.
    * **Firestore Database:** Our primary NoSQL database for real-time storage and synchronization of trekker data, statuses, and Points of Interest.

## Important Note on API Keys & Security

For the purpose of this project demonstration and to ensure the application's full functionality is immediately accessible to judges and reviewers directly from this public repository, API keys and Firebase configuration details are included directly in the client-side code.

I want to emphasize that **in a real-world, production environment, these sensitive credentials would absolutely be managed securely** using environment variables, server-side proxies, or other secure methods to prevent any public exposure. This repository is intended for evaluation purposes only and will be removed after the project evaluation period.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas for Surakshaa v2.0)

* **Guardian Dashboard:** A dedicated interface for guardians to manage multiple trekkers, view history, and receive alerts.
* **Route Planning & Geo-fencing:** Allow trekkers to pre-define routes and trigger alerts if they deviate.
* **Offline Capabilities:** Basic functionality in areas with no network coverage.
* **Battery Monitoring:** Alerts for low trekker device battery levels.
* **Detailed Location History:** Ability to review past treks and locations.
